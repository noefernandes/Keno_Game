# Description

Keno is a casino-style game in which the player has a cash value as an investment, provides the number of rounds he wants to play and a set of numeric values with 15 being the maximum size.
The "machine" will then create a set of 20 values. Depending on how many numbers you bet and how many numbers you hit, you will receive each round your invested amount divided by the number of rounds and multiplied by the resulting coefficient according to your hits.
The implementation of this version of the game was performed using the KenoBet class with its methods and using the vector class exhaustively.

# How to run

- g++ -Wall -std=c++11 src/main.cpp src/keno.cpp -I include/ -o keno
